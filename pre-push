# The full path of the expenses artefact md file is:
# /tmp/expense/index.md (in order not to disturb the
#                        one in the repository)
hugo --quiet -d /tmp

# To learn more about hugo CLI options, you can either
# run `hugo --help` or `tldr hugo`
# (please search for both CLI options: --quiet and -d)

# Compare the two files without output (this command
# is more suitale to what we want than diff)
cmp public/expense/index.md /tmp/expense/index.md

# To learn more about cmp, run `man cmp``
