## Introduction

This is my new payments sheet.

It is different from the gist I used previously to keep track of my expenses.

## FAQ

_How is it different?_

I am now using a site generator (`hugo`) to generate my expenses markdown file from JSON data.

_Where is the final markdown file located?_

It can be found at [public/expense/index.md](https://github.com/EMMANUELKUS/expenses-hugo/tree/master/public/expense/index.md)

_Where is this JSON file located?_

It can be found at [data/expenses.json](https://github.com/EMMANUELKUS/expenses-hugo/tree/master/data/expenses.json)

_How does HUGO know how to transform JSON into markdown?_


It uses the data as instructed in the template file.

_Where is the template file located?_

It can be found at [layouts/_default/expense.md.md](https://github.com/EMMANUELKUS/expenses-hugo/tree/master/layouts/_default/expense.md.md)

_How does the template instruct HUGO, what templating language does it use?_

It uses Golang's templating language.

_Do we edit the final markdown file directly? Why?_

No, you don't need to edit final markdown file dirctly because HUGO generates it automatically.

_What do we sometimes call the final markdown file, when generated by a site generator like HUGO?_

Artefact

_Why does the template filename end with `.md.md`?_

Templates always end with `.md`. After the templates is used to generate the artefact, the last `.md` is removed, and the other `.md` remains in the artefact filename.

```
./layouts/_default/expenses.md.md
                               ^ this is the extension of the template
                            ^ this is the extension of the artefact
```

> Example: a template that generates HTML will have the ending `.html.md`
